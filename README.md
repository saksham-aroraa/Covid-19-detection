# Introduction

This is a study in which the use of deep learning-based classifiers is observed to distinguish the highlights from COVID-19 radiological images such as CXR and CT scans, and prepare them from a combination of Pneumonia, other respiratory illnesses, and common cases.
The model uses a **Grad-CAM** approach to create class enactment maps. 
With this, a radiologist will be able to use our model both freely and closely. 
Because of the patients with Pneumonia, the model also focuses on False Positives (FP).
If a patient with Pneumonia is incorrectly identified as COVID-19 positive by our model, the patient will be contacted to be advertised in a COVID-19 area with an appropriate emergency clinic.

# General Architecture

The working of our model is as follows:
- First, images from 2 different datasets are taken as the input of our systems.
- Then basic transformations are applied on the image. (Converting them to black and white, and resizing them).
- Train-test split
- Then features are extracted from the image using convolutional layers
- The pixels are then shredded using pooling layers
- All the features then will be analyzed using fully-connected layer
- The interesting part in the image is then emphasized using Grad-CAM which finally gives the output.

# Review on various schemes

*Image acquisition:* 
Image acquisition was done using CT-scans and Chest X-Ray images acquired from 3 datasets which are: COVID-chest X-ray-dataset, SARS-COV-2 CT-scan, Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia).
ref. [41],[14],[3]
*Feature Extraction:*
Convolutional layers extracts feature from the image.
ref. [24],[25],[29]
*Image Pre-processing:*
Image Pre-processing is done in the pooling layer which further reduces the feature.
ref. [17],[12],[11]
*ROI from NON-ROI*
Grad-CAM separates ROI from non-ROI
ref. [36],[35],[34]
*Classification*
The fully connected layer does the feature analysis and it then passes output to GRAD-CAM which further focuses on ROI.

* Group-I
In group-I, researchers used Deep Neural Network as their major component. They have worked majorly on feature selection and classification. Asif Iqbal Khan et al. [32] have used CNN for feature selection which proved to be quite helpful in comparison to Wei Li et al. [34] and Ali Narin [38] as they have used RNN and SVM based models respectively.
* Group-II
In group-II, researchers used transfer learning as their major component. In this group, Sharvari Kalgutkar et al. [42] achieved accuracy values by 5-7% but found dataset scarcity as an issue. Also, Varan Singh Rohila et al. [16] proposed a new framework to detect the virus.
Overall, these models proved to be better at dealing with outliers, distorted and low-resolution images (except for Varalakshmi P. et al. [29], who used Sonograms for detection).
* Group-III
Here in Group-III, most of the papers were related to Image Pre-Processing, and important papers in this section were Michael J. Horry et al. [14], Ferhat Bozkurt et al. [21] and  Buyut Khoirul et al. [30], They had used CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), LBP (Local Binary Pattern) and Multimodal Imaging respectively, to better understand the data, by comparing with adjacent pixels.
* Group-IV
Papers in Group-IV were mostly based around Region of Interest (ROI) detection and feature extraction, few Note-worthy papers here were P.K. Gupta et al. [36] and Luca Burnese et al. [33], They elegantly showed application of ROI identification through Grad-CAM and VGG, and their accuracy regarding infected and healthy lungs were among the top, then one another important paper was Warda M. Shaban et al. [38] extracted features through a combination of SVM and KNN based models.

# Conclusions
*Among various schemes which is best for which application*

**GROUP-I**
Feature Extraction and Reduction + Classifier
Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance to various objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. CNN is the best model for image processing so we have chosen CNN for our objective.
An input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer make up a convolutional neural network. Any middle layer in a fed-forward neural network is considered to be hidden since the activation function and the final convolution hide their inputs and outputs. The hidden layers in a convolutional neural network are the layers that perform the convolution. Typically, this entails a layer that performs the dot product of the convolution kernel with the input matrix of the layer. The activation function of this product is normally ReLU, and it is generally a Frobenius inner product. The convolution operation creates a feature map as the convolution kernel slides along the input matrix for the layer. This contributes to the input of the next layer. other layers, such as pooling layers, completely connected layers, and normalisation layers, come next. 17 Except for convolution operations that take place in one or more layers of a CNN, CNNs are quite similar to vanilla neural networks. 

**Group-IV**
ROI Identification and Analysis
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) utilizes the gradients of any target feature flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map emphasising the essential regions in the image for predicting the concept.
Softmax is a mathematical process that converts a vector of integers into a vector of probabilities, with the probabilities of each value proportional to the vector's relative scale. The softmax function is most commonly used in applied machine learning as an activation function in a neural network model. The network is set up to produce N values, one for each class in the classification task, and the softmax function is used to normalise the outputs, converting them from weighted sum values to probabilities that add up to one. 

ISSUES IN EXISTING SYSTEMS
* Previous systems simply classified the input.
  * Existing systems simply classified the users whether they are CoVID positive or not. They don't provide any further knowledge in that direction
* More data can be levered to improve the overfitting issue.
  * As we have seen previously most of the papers had issue of overfitting due to lack of data availability, and they have also mentioned that they had issues while training their models due to un-availability of data.
* Training and testing time were significantly high.
  * It was also observed in some papers due to ongoing pandemic most of the papers were published their work immediately without any proper tuning and testing.

# Module descriptions 
**Grad-CAM:**
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) utilizes the gradients of any target 
feature flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map emphasizing the essential regions in the image for predicting the concept.
Grad-CAM can be used for weakly-supervised localization, i.e., determining the location of particular objects using a model that was trained only on whole-image labels rather than explicit location annotations.

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):**
An input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer make up a convolutional neural network. Any middle layer in a fed-forward neural network is considered to be hidden since the activation 
function and the final convolution hide their inputs and outputs. The hidden layers in a convolutional neural network are the layers that perform the convolution. Typically, this entails a layer that performs the dot product of the convolution kernel with the input matrix of the layer. The activation function of this product is normally ReLU, and it is generally a Frobenius inner product. The convolution operation creates a feature map as the convolution kernel slides along the input matrix for the layer. This contributes to the input of the next layer. other layers, such as pooling layers, completely connected layers, and normalization layers, come next.
Except for convolution operations that take place in one or more layers of a CNN, CNNs are quite similar to vanilla neural networks. 

* **VGG-16**
VGG16 is a convolutional neural network model developed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman of the University of oxford in their paper "Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image 
recognition." In ImageNet, a dataset of over 14 million images belonging to 1ooo classes, the model achieves 92.7 percent top-5 test accuracy. It was one of the well-known models shown at the ILSVRC-2o14. It improves on AlexNet by replacing large kernel-sized filters (11 and 5 in the first and second convolutional layers, respectively) with several 33 kernel-sized filters one

</p>

Unfortunately, VGG.net has two significant flaws:
- Training is very slow.
- The network architecture weight (in relation to disk/bandwidth) is rather large.
VGG16 is over 533MB in size because to its depth and the number of completely connected nodes. This makes VGG deployment a difficult process.

We used VGG16 with imagenet weights and all the internal layers with their pre-trained weights in our project. To get the outcome, we used pooling, densification, dropout, and a flattened layer. A softmax function is also used in the final layer. The model was created with Adam as the optimizer and accuracy as the optimization matrix.

* **DENSE NET121**
DenseNet (Dense Convolutional Network) is an architecture that employs fewer connections 
between layers to make deep learning networks increasingly deeper while also making them more economical to train. DenseNet is a convolutional neural network with each layer connected to all other layers deep in the network, for example, the first layer is connected to the second, third, fourth, and so on; the second layer is connected to the third, fourth, fifth, and so on. This is done to guarantee that the greatest amount of data can move between the levels of the network. It does not integrate features by putting them together, like ResNets do, but rather by combining them. The 'ith' layer, for example, has an I input and includes all of the previous convolutional blocks' feature maps. 

All succeeding 'eye-eye' layers get their own feature maps. It uses the '(I(I+1))/2' connection to link the network, rather than the 'I' connection used in normal deep learning designs. Because no unnecessary feature mappings must be trained, it uses fewer parameters than typical convolutional neural networks.

</p>

Traditional fed-forward neural networks link the outputs of the previous layer to the next layer after conducting a composite of operations. 

We can look at feature maps as network data. Each layer has access to its previous feature maps and, as a result, to the collective knowledge. Then, in a fe–∞ture map of solid k information, each layer adds a new piece of information to the collection

DenseNets uses a fundamental connection rule to merge the qualities of identity mapping, deep observation, and various depths. They allow network features to be reused, resulting in more compact and, in our experience, more accurate model learning. Because of their compact internal representations and minimal feature redundancy, DenseNets can be useful feature extractors for a variety of computer vision applications based on convolutional features

* **RESNET50**
ResNet, or Residual Networks, is a traditional neural network that is used as a backbone in many computer vision applications. The winner of the ImageNet challenge in 2015 was this model. The fundamental breakthrough with ResNet was that it allowed us to successfully train extremely deep neural networks with 150+ layers. Due to the problem of vanishing gradients, training very deep neural networks was challenging prior to ResNet.

However, just stacking layers together will not increase network depth. Because of the infamous disappearing gradient problem, which occurs when a gradient is back-propagated to earlier layers, repeated multiplication can cause the gradient to become extremely tiny. As a result, as the network becomes more complex, its performance becomes saturated or even degrades fast.

The concept of skip connection was initially introduced by ResNet. The graphic below shows how to skip a connection. The figure on the left shows stacking convolution layers one on top of the other. on the right, we stack convolution layers as before, but now we additionally add the original input to the convolution block's output. This is referred to as a skip connection

The reason why skipping connections works is because:
- They allow the model to learn an identity function, ensuring that the higher layer will perform at least as well as the lower layer, if not better.
- They mitigate the problem of disappearing gradient by enabling gradient to flow along an alternate shortcut channel.

The ResNet-50 model is made up of five stages, each having its own convolution and identity block. Each convolution block contains three convolution layers, and each identity block contains three as well. over 23 million trainable parameters make up the ResNet-50.

For producing visual explanations for our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) ‚Äìbased models we use Grad ‚Äì CAM based heatmaps. Below are the heatmaps produced by each model for the same image of the class: diagnosed as CoVID-19. Note that these heatmaps are produced from weights calculated by the last convolutional layer in each network:

* VGG-16 (Non-CoVID)

**Inference:** we can see that the last layer of VGG-16 is not focusing on lung tissues because it‚Äôs a Non-CoVID case.

Conclusion and Future Work

In this work, we used binary image classification to identify CoVID-19 and non-CoVID19 positive patients.
According to the study, non-CoVID-19 positive patients may have Pneumonia or other respiratory problems.
Several experiments have employed CXR and CT-Scan images of the chest to detect CoVID-19 patients.

In order to make our deep learning model more interpretable and explainable, we used a color visualisation method utilizing the GRAD-CAM technique in our trials which could be further used in other research or acedemia purposes, for eg, using them in a bigger application or passing them in a pipeline.
